This repository showcases a common error in Rust related to unsafe raw pointers and vector manipulation.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that directly modifies a vector using a raw pointer. This approach is generally discouraged due to its potential for undefined behavior and memory safety violations. The `bugSolution.rs` demonstrates a safer way to achieve the same result, using standard library methods.
